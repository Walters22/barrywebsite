When you create a Trello board, it is made up into three sections  one section is what to one you filled in your card you save it then you move the your first card into the Do section that show you got to do that task once you have com[late the task on that card them you move it to finished section. Then you make a new card for the next task of your project.
            Unit 1.4. Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?
            The Top 9 Reasons for IT Project Failure: Is Your Project at Risk?
            According to a 2017 report from the Project Management Institute (PMI), 14 percent of IT projects fail. However, that number only represents the total failures. Of the projects that didn’t fail outright, 31 percent didn’t meet their goals, 43 percent exceeded their initial budgets, and 49 percent were late.
            According to the PMI, six factors must be met for a project to be successful:
            <p>It’s delivered on time.
                Its cost doesn’t exceed its budget.
                It works as designed.
                People use it.
                The people who funded the project are happy with it.
                It meets the goals that drove the project.
                
            
                <p>focus on Your Pain Points
                    Fundamentally, technology is a tool that helps you do what you do better, faster, or more efficiently. The key to choosing the right technology for your business is to understand what you’re already doing well, and what you need to do better.
                    Figuring out your company’s biggest pain points is the key to knowing where you can improve, and that process starts with talking to your team. First and foremost, you want to know how they spend their time each day. A good place to start is to ask everyone to take a moment to estimate how much time they devote to various, but specific activities each week. Make sure that you’re clear that you’re looking for company-wide trends, not scrutinizing individual employees’ time management. 
                    Once you have that data, you should look for information that might surprise you. Are people spending an inordinate amount of time just catching up on email? That might point to a need for a more efficient communication or collaboration solution for your team. Are slow internet and Wi-Fi speeds creating bottlenecks and slowing down your day-to-day operations? A scalable internet solution that will grow with your business may be the answer.

Essentially, using copyrighted material is a legal right. Examples of fair use might include:
            
            Educational purposes, such as teaching and student research;
            Making commentary and criticism as part of a news report or published article.
