<p>Hi my is Barry, I have a good life and a good schooling unit. I reached the age of 16 years old when I left school and joined the Army. I was in the Army for about 12 years, Then I left and   met a girl called Vickie. I quite like her so I got married to Her also we have 3 lovely children, 2 girls and one boy. Now all our children have grown up now and have children of their own, now my wife Vickie and myself have six grandchildren.   
    Since i came out of the Army I had some low paid Jobs in my life Once i came a Sheff  I quite like that  like to cook  i were good at but I had an accident with one of my legs now it stop me working on my feet for along time. Now I have tok g to do with computers look for a sit job now something to do with Computers, that's  why I came to Codenation to learn coding and how to build websites, also In my life time I am an Artist too.
