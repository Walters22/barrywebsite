    <p>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approcching as needed - in making your own website, are you
        happy with tools you used? Eg visual studio code, Trello.

    </p>


    <p>
        I am very happy with my website. When I came here I did not know to build a Website, by using the right approach
        and the right tools to do this job and the know-how and also getting to use visual studio code such as X code
        and HTML and CSS to develop my website. Also the Trello Board too. WHY? Do I like the Xcode web page program, so
        when you use the Visual Studio Code for the first time you open it up and start with a blank page first, then
        you started to write into on to it adding bits of characters with in you coding with one of those character
        before you had some text then you close the text with one of those > then Press button Command and the S key to
        save after you added the text. And also the Trello board was a good idea has while you are doing project like my
        website it help me to keep on track when i did a tasks on my webpage, i can go onto my trello board and put that
        job into one of the trello cards then i go back on my last task to see the last job what i did on my webpage.
        Yes I do like this trello board it was easy to use and i like it being set up and easy to follow and also what I
        like about it is how it's laid out it is so very colourful. In the future in my own work I will be using a
        Trello board from now on at home or work.
    </p>


    <p>
        2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate Eg Visual studio code Trello Board.
    </p>


    <p>Yes I like using those IT tools while I was on this computer cause doing Codenation, it was the first time use
        those tools the answer to the question is yes did like using the IT appropriate tools for this project, like
        last week I were working in a team of people to build a coffee app, without the appropriate tools we would not
        do this task with out them or without the Trello board to keep us up to date on are coffee app. Trello was
        appropriate to use because every job on our coffee app we always use the trello board to look back what to
        remember, use what to do on our coffee app, it can be used as a tracker to keep track how we are going on our
        project.

    <p>2.3 Assess the strengths and weakness of your final project-are happy with your website? You should review it on
        the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</p>


    <p>While I starting to build my website I was through about my art work when I was a student in my pass time, I
        would like to use my painting within the background of my website behind the text so I try that by downloading
        my images and put them into a folder within HTML, by using the appropriate tools within this program i this task
        so easily. Once the image is on the webpage. Now I use some images of my paintings. It looks ok how I did this
        but I could see what wrote so that was a weakness for me if I can not see now one can read what wrote that was a
        different a weakness. So I went away to think about this, I had to find the right colour for my text to stand
        out from the background images that I used for my webpage. So I change the colour of my text. I decided a strong
        colour for my text to stand out so you can read it. I did that by using one of the tools in this program in the
        HTML program. The strengths of a good website is make sure everything works on your web page such as if your
        links are working if you got movement within your web page make sure it moves when you click on it if it is very
        interesting and big and bold and colourful. And easy on the eyes to look at and to read it.</p>

    <p>2.4 Describe further improvement you can make to your project?</p>



    <p>like my webpage. But if I had lots of time with my web page I could improve it by bringing to life adding 3- D
        images within my web page and making them move, and sound such as music and speech to the characters within my
        web page and I also I will add in some tabs where you can click onto to go to the next page I would to design my
        web page to tell a story when someone goes and take a look on the web page it would take that person on a
        journey about my art world it will gu you all the different artist and their art works and paintings of
        different years of art and paintings. What I would do with my web page to get everyone interested to see what
        kind Art they like and also I would like to make my paintings to tell a story about the artist who painted them
        that would be interesting to see. With all the tools what I learnt to use to make this web page.</p>


    <p>2.5 Review the outcomes to make sure they meet many requirements and are fit for purpose?</p>


    <p>Before you start to start a new project you make sure you are organising yourself to meet their requirements by
        using the right visual studio program for your project and the tools as well and also make a new Tello Board and
        keep updating it to keep on track. If you have to change your file if necessary for your document to display on
        your website. And every job you do on your project makes sure you update your Trello board to meet the
        requirements. If you do it, your project will go wrong because you are not doing the job right. I will make sure
        I prepare appropriate content for my site by doing the following. A good layout of a good web page is a content
        with lots of text or information and backed up with images for each page by making it look good and interesting.
        The layout of your webpage is
        important.</p>
    <p> So I went back to take a look at 1.1 to refirth to form an idea to write about on this unit 2.5.
        Unit Outcome 3 (review)</p>


    <p>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency -
        could you have been more deficient when making your web site ? could you have done it in a team?
        By working in a team you can share the work to do with this project, and have a member of a team you have given
        a job to within this project. Is important to share the jobs out so it makes it easy to get the project finished
        on time. I could use tools like Trello and Slack to delegate and share tasks and make my project more productive
        and efficient. Like they say is “many hands lighten the load” that means if we pull together we will get a
        project quicker That.s it is better working in a team than on your own. </p>



    <p>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency?</p>

    <p>If you are working in IT or using a computer at home or at work, you should alway have breaks. The reason why is
        if don’t your body will suffer and you will suffer too, if your computer is not the right height with your head
        your neck begin to hurt and your eyes will get tired that will affect your work to you will feel sleepy. That is
        why you should take breaks how often you can go for walks, have a drink, move away from the computer screen to
        give your eyes a break more often when you can.</p>


    <p>>3.3 Describe ways to improve solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects what would you
        do definitely next? Use of SLACK</p>

    <p>By working with a team on a project together, sharing the jobs with each other is expected, however if we are in
        work and we stopped working on the project if there is something is wrong with this project if you can not any
        member of your team to talk about their work on the project We can send messages on a program called Slack it a
        communication aid like facebook massager you can write messages to to each other if you can not see each other .
        That.s SLACK is so good also you can send images too. It is a good tool to use.</p>

    <p>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing your digital solutions.s</p>

    <p>Once your project is finished how you go about testing it out your project You would try it out with a test run
        to see if it working or not. If it's working go and see what is not working and fix it that's why you test it
        before you sell your project to outside people such as companies you got to make sure it's working. If you can,
        you can not sell it and you will lose money or jobs. How would i test my project is working, I would open my
        project like my new web page, once it open i would check all my links are working and my tabs by click on to
        them to if will take me to the next page if they are working, then I click onto the images to if thay thay do so
        all the links all work that's ok ot i would check out the background and the text to see if I can read it and
        follow it if every is ok everything is working on my web page it is ready to go.</p>


    <p> 2 outcome 1</p>

    <p>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page?

        On my web page is important the layout and the contents on your web page have to be the same on both of your web
        pages. If they don't work you may lose some of your pages. On the first page I have answered all the questions
        on this page also on the second page each is different all the content on each page is different and the layout
        too. Now on my own web page I got all the information about myself and my Wife and my family and also my images
        of my paintings or art work on both pages and on the second page I also got my images of painting and the
        question of what I answer as well.</p>
