    What we mean when we talk about accessibility

    The word ‘accessibility’ gets used a lot. I have lots of conversations about it. People often have a different understanding to me of what it means, and that can make having effective conversations difficult.
    Often, the word gets used to describe how many people can use something. For example, “putting it online will increase the accessibility of the service”.
    When talking about the accessibility of a website, it is often understood to mean someone that is blind is able to use it.
    When talking about the accessibility of a building, it is usually taken to mean that someone in a wheelchair can get into and use the building.
    From 23 September 2019 the law around website accessibility is changing for public sector organisations.

<p>Unit 1.7 Describing which are the appropriate file types for websites.
    What are the Best File Formats for Your Website's Images?
    
    With current browsers supporting more file types than ever before, it is important that you are clued up on which file formats work best on your website for different images. Do you know what format you should use for your logo? Or which format you should save your photographs in?
    Using the wrong file format can affect the way images appear on your website and may determine whether users can in fact see those images. As well as this, incorrect file formats can have a negative effect on your page speed. Choosing the Best File Format
    As there are many different file formats to choose from, we have selected the four we think work best on the web: a JPEG, PNG, SVG and GIF, all of which contain a lossy or lossless compression. A lossy compression means images lose information and quality once the file size decreases whereas a lossless compression does not lose any detail when the file size is changed.
    JPEG
    Joint Photographics Expert Group - otherwise known as a JPEG or JPG are the most popular choice when saving photographs as they are capable of containing over 16 million different colours. They are also a good choice for saving images with complex colour and shading.
    JPEGs are probably the best file format for photographs on the web as the level of flexible compression when saving means they are capable of shrinking to a smaller file size and, therefore, they won’t have a negative effect on pagespeed. For example, a compressed 80KB image won’t take as long to load as a 8MB image as its smaller size means it requires less resources to load.
    However, when it comes to graphics and text, JPEGS are not the best option as they use lossy compression, meaning they lose a lot of information when saved, making text or lines blurry in the process. Therefore, PNGs or GIFs would be the better choice.
</p>PNG
Depending on which PNG you use (either PNG-8 or PNG-24). the more colours you can include. PNG-8s are capable of containing a maximum of 256 colours whereas a PNG-24 can contain an unlimited amount of colours. This means they are not just suitable for images, but also graphics and text. PNGs also give you control over transparency, unlike JPEGs, which makes them pretty much perfect for logos. PNGs also use a lossless compression, meaning they don’t lose any information or quality.
One of the main drawbacks of using PNGs, however, is that some web browsers do not support them. If your logo is saved as a PNG and someone is viewing your website on a browser that does not support them, it simply won’t appear.
GIFs tend to be much smaller file sizes compared to other formats and aren’t capable of containing millions of colours. Just like PNGs, GIFs also support transparency, which would make them suitable for small graphics and logos, and due to their small file size, this format is great for placing lots of small graphics such as icons and buttons on the same page.
As GIFs can hold both text and transparent backgrounds, they are perfect for creating banners that intend to hold text on top of colours or images. However, as GIFs can’t handle as many colours as a JPEG or PNG, they aren’t suitable for photographs and images with lots of colour and shading.
The most interesting thing about GIFs is that they can be animated, meaning you can make moving images for your website such as an animated logo because they are raster based. Although the quality wouldn’t be amazing, you can also cut film clips and save them as a GIF to upload to your website.
